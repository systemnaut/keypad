My first little notepad (released to the world for fun)

This tiny repo has my very first software ever; it was a simple mini text box I made to hold my homework on the bus before transferring it over Bluetooth thru the notes app when I got home. It's got a special spot in my heart, and so it is also the name of the default text editor in the Lidshell user interface in Lidslate (see (systemnaut.com)[https://www.systemnaut.com] to see a list of all my projects or the 'lidslate' repo here on GitHub to learn more).
